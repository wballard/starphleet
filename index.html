  <blockquote>
    <p>Starphleet is a toolkit for turning virtual or physical machine infrastructure into a continuous deployment stack, running multiple Git-backed services on one or more nodes via Linux containers.
    </p>
    <p>Starphleet borrows heavily from the concepts of the Twelve-Factor App, and uses an approach that avoids many of the problems inherent in existing autodeployment solutions:
    </p>
  </blockquote>

  <ul>
    <li>Conventional virtualization, with multiple operating systems running on shared physical hardware, wastes resources, specifically RAM and CPU. This costs real money.</li>
    <li>Autodeploy PaaS has the same vendor lock-in risks of old proprietary software.</li>
    <li>Continuous deployment is almost always a custom scripting exercise.</li>
    <li>Multiple machine / clustered deployment is extra work.</li>
    <li>Making many small services is more work than making megalith services.</li>
    <li>Deployment systems all seem to be at the system not service level.</li>
    <li>Every available autodeploy system requires that you set up servers to deploy your servers, which themselves aren't autodeployed.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="features">Features</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Linux CGROUP and container isolation</li>
    <li>Continuous Deployment</li>
    <li>Centralized Configuration</li>
    <li>Easily combine many micro-services into a large application</li>

  <h3 id="phleet">Phleet</h3>
  <p>A phleet is a grouping of
    <a href="#ship">starphleet ships</a>. The entire phleet points to a single
    <a href="#headquartersrepo">headquarters</a>. These ships may be geographically located for latency or maintained in a single region. A phleet is comprised of machines that are intended to be identical for easy scaling.
    <h3 id="ship">Ship</h3>
    <p>
      A ship is an Ubuntu 14.04 EC2 instance running a base install of Ubuntu. The starphleet installation will handle installing all needed software on the server.
    </p>
    <h3 id="headquartersrepo">Headquarters</h3>
    <p>
      The headquarters is a special
      <a href="https://github.com/wballard/starphleet.headquarters">Git repo</a>
      that is the
      <i>brains</i>
      of your
      <a href="#phleet">phleet</a>. The Headquarters will store all your environment and configuration options. This repo will also contain all your credentials and confidential information. It is important to keep your headquarter security restrictive. An example and template headquarters can be found
      <a href="https://github.com/wballard/starphleet.headquarters">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="orders">Orders</h3>
    <p>The orders file is a special file inside a subdirectory off the root directory of the
      <a href="#headquartersrepo">headquarters</a>.</p>

    <p>Each subdirectory off the root of the
      <a href="#headquartersrepo">headquarters</a>
      is checked for an orders file. Starphleet will look inside the orders file for deploy commands and environment variables for the service. There is a 1-1 mapping between the subdirectory that contains an orders file and the url of the service deployed.</p>
    <h3 id="service">Service</h3>
    <p>A service is an app that responds to web requests.  The service should listen for web requests on the <code>$PORT</code> set in the Environment.  The service lives within an LXC Container and will be handed requests by the NGINX front end on the <a href="#ship">ship</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="remotes">Remote</h3>
    <p>Remotes are GitHub repos that are not intended to be deployed.  These special repos are instead intended to be resources for applications.  By specifying a remote inside a <a href="#service">service</a> endpoint directory the GitHub repo will be automatically checked out and synced in the <code>/var/data/$service_name</code> directory.</p>
  </p>
</section>

<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="headquarters" class="page-header">Headquarters</h1>
  <p> The <a href="#headquartersrepo">Starphleet Headquarters</a> is a Git repo with all the master configurations for the entire <a href="#phleet">phleet</a> of servers. It will contain the deploy commands for every service, keys for ssh console access to the <a href="#ship">ships</a>, ssl certificates for the domain(s) you assign to the ship, configuration settings for authentication for each service as well as how the machine can reach LDAP servers, and any other major configuration item. </p>

  <h1 id="overrides">Overrides</h1>
  <p> Most of the configuration in Starphleet is handled by setting environment variables.  Starphleet exposes several environment variables to the applications that run in the containers.  You can set environment variables for a container in a few ways: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Globally Across the <a href="#phleet">Phleet</a></li> <li>Per-Ship</li>
    <li>Per-Service</li>
  </ul>
  <p> It is also important to note that the above list also represents the order in which the environment is overridden. </p>
  <h3 id="overridesglobally">Globally</h3>
  <p> Environment Variables set globally will be available to all services on all <a href="#ship">ships</a> in the <a href="#phleet">phleet</a>.  You can set these global environment files in the HQ in the <code>.starphleet</code> <a href="#reservedfiles">reserved file</a>. </p>
  <h3 id="overridespership">Per-Ship</h3>
  <p> In some cases it might be necessary to set environment variables that are specific to each <a href="#ship">ship</a> in a <a href="#phleet">phleet</a>.  These variables might be unique to a ship like its location.  These environment variables get set by adding files to a special directory on the ship.  Any file located in the <code>/etc/starphleet.d</code> directory will be sourced and available to all environments in Starphleet. </p>
  <h3 id="overridesperservice">Per-Service</h3>
  <p>
    The <a href="#orders">orders file</a> used to deploy a container also acts as the final location to set environment variables and override any defaults set upstream from your service.  Common settings in the orders file would include locations to resources, DB credentials, and the <a href="#authentication">authentication</a> mechanism you want Starphleet to use for your service.

  <h3 id="howbuildpackswork">How Buildpacks Work</h3>
  <p>Buildpacks autodetect and provision services in containers for you. We would like to give a huge thanks to Heroku for having open buildpacks, and to the open source community for making and extending them. The trick that makes the Starphleet <a href="#orders">orders file</a> so simple is the use of buildpacks and platform package managers to install dynamic, service specific code, such as rubygems or npm and associated dependencies, that may vary with each push of your service. Note that
    <b>Starphleet will only deploy one buildpack per Linux container</b>
    - for services which are written in multiple languages, custom buildpacks may be required.</p>
  <p>Starphleet currently includes support for Ruby, Python, NodeJS, and NGINX static buildpacks.</p>

  <h3 id="publicconfiguration">Public Configuration</h3>
  <p> Assigning the <code>SECURITY_MODE</code> setting to <code>public</code> requires no additional configuration.  Starphleet will serve the content behind a public endpoint openly. </p>
  <h3 id="ldapconfiguration">LDAP Configuration</h3>
  <p> Assigning the <code>SECURITY_MODE</code> setting to <code>ldap</code> requires additional configuration in the <a href="#headquarters">headquarters</a>.  The following is required: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Create a <code>ldap_servers</code> folder in your <a href="#headquarters">headquarters</a></li>
    <li>
      Create a file with your LDAP settings inside the file.  The name of the file will be used by your services to reference this configuration.  The file should look like this:
{% highlight bash %}
export LDAP_URL='ldap://guardian-gc.glgresearch.com:3268/dc=glgroup,dc=com?sAMAccountName?sub?(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=User)'
export LDAP_USER='domain\\sampleServiceAccount'
export LDAP_PASSWORD='****' {% endhighlight %}
    </li>
    <li>In your <a href="#orders">orders file</a>, set <code>SECURITY_MODE</code> to <code>ldap</code>.  Set <code>LDAP_SERVER</code> to the name of the above file you just created</li>
  </ul>
  <p> Your orders file will now have <code>ldap</code> enabled and point to the above configuration on which LDAP server to use for authentication.  At this point, your service should be authenticating against LDAP. </p>
  <h3 id="jwtconfiguration">JWT Configuration</h3>
  <p> JWT Authentication works by looking for a specific token when a request is made.  If the token is invalid the request silently redirects to a service running on the same ship.  The service is responsible for authenicating the user and providing a token.  The token can then be used to retry the original request.  Details about utilizing JWT authenication can be found <a href="#jwtdetails">here</a>.
  <h3 id="htpasswdconfiguration">HTPASSWD Configuration</h3>
  <p> Assigning the <code>SECURITY_MODE</code> setting to <code>htpasswd</code> requires an additional environment settings in the <a href="#headquarters">headquarters</a>.  You can set this <a href="#overridesglobally">globally</a> or <a href="overridesperservice">per-service</a>.  To get the appropriate string you can use the linux <code>htpasswd</code> command like the following:</a></p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ htpasswd -n -b changeusername changepasswd
changeusername:$apr1$O7LcRpBk$Pv17p..kUwbcw5rxM4AEr0 {% endhighlight %}
  <p> Copy the resulting string from above into a variable named <code>HTPASSWD</code>. </p>
  <h3 id="accesscontrollists">Access Control Lists</h3>
  <p>If you enable ldap or htpasswd authentication you can also limit a service to certain users. To enable per-user access to a service add a file to your service endpoint directory with the extension .acl. The file should contain a list of users separated by newlines.</p>
  <p>Example (<code>example.acl</code>):</p>
{% highlight bash %}
jdoe
jjdoe
jsmith{% endhighlight %}
  <p>The above service endpoint would only allow three users access - all others will be prompted to login.</p>

  <h1 id="jwtdetails" class="page-header">JWT Details</h1>
    <p> JWT Authentication works by looking for a specific jwt token when a request is received by Starphleet.  If the jwt token is invalid the request silently redirects to a service running on the same ship.  The service is responsible for authenicating the user and providing a token.  The token can then be used to retry the original request.
    <p> There are three ways to pass a JWT token with your request: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Url Param</li>
      <li>Cookie</li>
      <li>Header</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
     When Starphleet receives a valid JWT Token as part of a request to a JWT authenticated service the jwt token is used to create a global cookie.  The cookie is used to maintain the "session" of the user.  The cookie name can be configured by setting the <code>JWT_COOKIE_NAME</code> configuration variable.  It is important that the <code>JWT_AUTH_SITE</code> and service protected by JWT all use the same <code>JWT_COOKIE_NAME</code>.
    </p>
  <h3 id="jwturlparam">Url Parameter</h3>
    <p>

    </p>
  <h3 id="jwtcookie">JWT Cookie</h3>
  <h3 id="jwtheader">Url Parameter</h3>
    <p> Assigning the <code>SECURITY_MODE</code> setting to <code>jwt</code> requires additional settings in the <a href="#headquarters">headquarters</a>.  You can configure these settings <a href="#overridesglobally">globally</a> or <a href="overridesperservice">per-service</a>.</p>
    <p> JWT Requires the following settings:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>JWT_SECRET</li>
      <li>JWT_AUTH_SITE</li>
      <li>JWT_COOKIE_DOMAIN</li>
      <li>JWT_COOKIE_NAME</li>
      <li>JWT_EXPIRATION_IN_SECONDS</li>
      <li>JWT_ACCESS_FLAGS</li>
    </ul>
    <p> These settings are explained in the <a href="#securitysettings">security settings</a> section. </p>
    <p>
      Unlike other security methods
    </p>
    <p> JWT requires an authentication application: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>This is the service to which unauthenticated users will be redirected. This service is not provided by Starphleet. Because the logic for authenticating users is domain specific, the implementer must provide this service.</li>
      <li>This site must be open to non-authenticated users. It is responsible for:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Determining whether the user is valid</li>
        <li>Constructing the payload for the JWT token. The payload may include any meta data the implementer would like. <b>NOTE:</b> The payload in any JWT token is encoded, but not encrypted and should never contain sensitive information.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The payload property role is reserved by Starphleet</li>
          <li>Starphleet will check values in the role when determining whether to grant access to the service</li>
          <li>Starphleet expects the values to be comma-delimited</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Signing the JWT token, which includes the payload</li>
        <li>Redirecting the user to the original target destination with the signed JWT token in a querystring paramter named jwt.</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="healthchecks" class="page-header">Healthchecks</h1>
  <p><a href="#orders">orders</a> service repository can supply a <code>$HEALTHCHECK</code> like:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
export HEALTHCHECK='/'{% endhighlight %}
<p>Upon deployment of a service update, Starphleet will issue a GET request to http://{container_ip}:{PORT}/{HEALTHCHECK}, and will expect an HTTP 200 response within 60 seconds. The {PORT} in the preceding URL will have the value specified in your orders.</p>
<p>If you fail the check, the service doesn't deploy.</p>

<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="cronjobs" class="page-header">Cron Jobs</h1>
  <p>Starphleet lets you specify <code>#@</code> directives in shell scripts in order to schedule jobs in a container. These with in containers with services, so the most common thing you do is curl yourself:</p>
{% highlight bash %}
#!/usr/bin/env bash
#@ * * * * 1

#This is a simple sh-at scheduled job example, it just hits the local
#service -- which is on the container itself and so isn't at /echo
curl http://localhost/on_container

#and you can always hit the ship, in which case you need to use the service
#url /echo
curl http://localship/echo/on_ship {% endhighlight %}
  <p>The #@ directive is just a cron scheduling expression captured inside the script itself.</p>

<section class="bs-docs-section">
  <h1 id="devmode" class="page-header">Development Mode</h1>
  <p>When Starphleet is installed on your local machine through vagrant the behavior of starphleet changes in a way that facilitates local development. Starphleet becomes your automated build-and-test environment. Starphleet will manage the following tasks for you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Checking out all GIT repos and remote files associated with your headquarters</li>
    <li>Mapping the above mentioned repos to your machine</li>
    <li>Automated Container Deployment on file changes (saves) (<a href="#unbindingdevdirectory">optional</a>)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Utilizing Starphleet as your build-and-test environment has the benefit of simplifying your workflow. This also allows you to test your code changes against a real Starphleet environment that mimics your production systems.</p>
  <h3 id="devmodeinstallation">Installation</h3>
  <p>
    Installing the <a href="#developmentmode">Devmode</a> version of Starphleet doesn't require additional steps.  Starphleet will automatically detect it has not been loaded on an Amazon instance and enable <a href="#developmentmode">Devmode</a>.  To get Starphleet installed on your machine you can find installation instructions <a href="#installation">here</a>.
  </p>
  <h3 id="howdevmodeworks">Configuration</h3>
  <p>There are several ways you can configure the environment for a local Starphleet deployment:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Export your variables manually</li>
    <li>Create an environment file located at <code>${HOME}/.starphleet</code> and export the <a href="#requireddevmodevariables"> required variables.</a></li>
    <li>Utilize web installation scripts (Examples can be found here)</li>
    <li>Run the appropriate deployment script (ex vmware) and answer the prompts</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="requireddevmodevariables">Required Installation Variables</h3>
  <p>
    At a minimum you will need an un-password protected SSH key associated with your Git account for any private repositories associated with your Headquarters. You will need the following environment variables:
  </p>
{% highlight bash %}
export STARPHLEET_HEADQUARTERS="https://github.com/wballard/starphleet.headquarters.git"
export STARPHLEET_PRIVATE_KEY="${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa"
export STARPHLEET_PUBLIC_KEY="${HOME}/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"{% endhighlight %}
  <h3 id="differencewithdevmode">Devmode Vs. Production</h3>
  <p>Starphleet normally handles the deployment of all services after any change to the Git repos and/or <a href="#orders">orders</a> envrionment.  When running Starphleet locally in development mode the behavior of Starphleet alters a bit.  These changes are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Git repos associated with your orders are checked out to a different location</li>
    <li>Git repos are monitored for file changes rather than git commit changes for triggering deployments (optional)</li>
    <li>Starphleet 'always' tries to start a dead container.</li>
    <li>Starphleet uses date stamps instead of git hashes for container names</li>
    <li>Your working git directory is linked directly to containers</li>
  </ul>
  <h3 id="unbindingdevdirectory">Unbind Dev Dir From Container</h3>
  <p>The default behavior of Development mode links your working development directory all the way into the virtual containers. This is ideal if your build system typically uses something like gulp watch. You can run gulp watch and your changes will be realized immediately all the way inside the service container.</p>
  <p>In some instances this behavior may be unfavorable. A few examples may be:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Your service doesn't use a build system</li>
    <li>The build-pack for your service runs a 'rebuild' against your development directory and changes many files</li>
    <li>You experience stability issues with HGFS in vmware</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    In these instances you may wish to unbind your development directory from the container. By adding a setting to your <a href="#orders">orders file</a> you can change the behavior of Starphleet to instead detect changes as you save them in your development directory and run a full re-deploy of your containers automatically. To trigger this behavior you can add the following to your 'orders' inside your headquarters.
  </p>
{% highlight bash %}
export DEVMODE_UNBIND_GIT_DIR="true" {% endhighlight %}
  <h3 id="authindevmode">Authentication</h3>
  <p>
    Some services depend on authentication. Starphleet automatically supports LDAP and htpasswd authentication. Services are written in such a way that they depend on HTTP headers that are provided by the authentication method. If you need to simulate authenticated services in development mode you can add the following variable to your <a href="#orders">orders file</a>:
  </p>
{% highlight bash %}
export DEVMODE_FORCE_AUTH="[username]" {% endhighlight %}
  <h3 id="disabledevmode">Disable Dev Mode</h3>
  <p>
    There may be instances where you want to force Starphleet to behave like a production environment locally on your machine. In those instances you can simply touch a file to disable Development Mode:
  </p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ touch /var/starphleet/live {% endhighlight %}
  <h3 id="startingdevmodeinstance">Starting Devmode Instance</h3>
  <p> Starting your vagrant instance after it has been halted requires a few additional steps.  Once your linux machine has booted you need to reboot the Starphleet service.  Run the following commands to start the vagrant instance: </p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ vagrant up
$ vagrant ssh
$ sudo restart starphleet {% endhighlight %}
  <h3 id="stoppingdevmodeinstance">Stopping Devmode Instance</h3>
  <p> After <a href="#vmware-fusion-install">installing</a> your local development environment you may want to stop the local instance of Starphleet.  It is important to use Vagrant to manage this process.  Specifically, you will want to run the following command: </p>
{% highlight bash %}
$ vagrant halt {% endhighlight %}
